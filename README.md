### Hi there, I'm Ian! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">

I'm a Software Engineer passionate about everything about data. I love to create new architectures around data and serving different applications to people. Over time I have worked on a wide variety of things, ranging from a sweet water fish classifier app in Tensorflow and Flutter to a numerical simulation of the solar system. Apart from that I have been working for more than 4 years on webapps and on data infrastructure. 

### Some things about me 🔬
